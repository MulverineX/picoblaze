Picoblaze - an experimental fabric mod for testing largely wanted ideas for data packs and mapmaking.

There are many modules, each of which are documented on [the wiki](https://github.com/lolgeny/picoblaze/wiki).
You can read about them there.

It may be buggy
(if you find a bug, I'd greatly appreciate a bug report)
and is a lot of an experiment to see if these features
would be useful in the vanilla game.

Of course, I'd also appreciate ideas and feedback too.
